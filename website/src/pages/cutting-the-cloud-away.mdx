# Cutting the ☁️ away

In the beginning the goal of this project, was to tell a visual narrative on the screens of a smart home temperature sensors. Ideally something like you can see on top of the website. Every dot that appears on one of the screen represents one unit that was sold, one person that put energy into this product. Ever ten minutes represents one month of selling.

With this idea in my mind I started on a journey, trying to hack a temperature sensor for accessing the screen. Everything began with learning about Tuya Convert.

## Learning about Tuya Convert

[Tuya Convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert) is an open-source project for flashing firmware on Tuya-based devices. The hack was found by Michael Steigerwald, founder of the German IT security startup VTRUST, which he presented during a [talk at 35C3 in Leibzig](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9723-smart_home_-_smart_hack).
After that talk, VTRUST and the German tech magazine c't worked together to make this hack accessible and open-sourced it on GitHub.

In particular [Tuya Convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert) helps you with flashing the [Tasmota firmware](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) wirelessly (also known as over-the-air). Tasmota is an open-source firmware for devices that are based on an ESPXXXX wifi chip. It enables you to control your devices locally without relying on a cloud service. It also allows you to create automations with your devices or lets you flash customized firmware on them. Tasmota offers a broad range of APIs for datapoints, even ones for screen-based devices like the temperature sensors.

After realizing that screen-based devices could be controlled via Tasmota, I was confident to be able to flash a temperature sensor with custom firmware. To be on the safe side I ordered a selection of different temperature sensors from Aliexpress. In the end, I ended up with the following devices:

- device 01
- device 02

Some of the devices I ordered are Zigbee devices. Those could not be flashed with Tuya Convert because they do not communicate over a Wifi Protocol but rather over the Zigbee Protocol.
The other devices worked over Wifi connection and therefore were suitable for the Tuya Convert exploit.

I ran the exploit on all the ordered devices following the instructions on the [README](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/blob/master/README.md). Every single one of them failed. On not one device I was able to flash the Tasmota firmware. Through opening the sensors up I learned that none of them were based on an ESPXXXX chip. Instead of relying further on the ESPXXXX chips, Tuya started to build own chips to equip their devices with such as the [CBU](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/cbu-module-datasheet?id=Ka07pykl5dk4u) or [CB3S](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/cb3s?id=Kai94mec0s076). This was a big set back, as I was not able to flash the BEKEN chips with Tuya Convert.

Luckily there was a new open source project on the horizon.

## Tuya Cloudcutter

[Tuya Cloudcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) is the successor of Tuya Convert for BEKEN based devices. The exploit was found by [Khaled Nassar](https://twitter.com/kmhnassar) and [Tom Clement](https://twitter.com/Tom_Clement) and [Jilles Groenendijk](https://twitter.com/jilles_com). It has a similar operating mode as Tuya convert, as it enables someone to flash new firmware on smart home devices over the air. With Tuya Cloudcutter it is possible to flas either ESPHome or OpenBeken firmware, which are similar in their usage to Tasmota. AS ESPHome has also documentation for controlling screen-based devices I decided to go with that.

Following again the instructions in the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md) and [HOST_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter/blob/main/HOST_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS.md), I tried the exploit and this time it worked! The exploit run through on two devices, the [TH08 temperature sensor](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004755749389.html) and the [WL-WIFI-HT temperature sensor](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B8HSJ4WG), using the [bk7231n-lowpower-common-ty-1.0.10](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter.github.io/blob/master/profiles/bk7231n-lowpower-common-ty-1.0.10-sdk-2.3.1-40.00.json) device profile. During this exploit a firmware called ESPHome Kickstart was flashed on the devices. This firmware is a minimal firmware that enables the user to flash a custom ESPHome firmware on the device. The ESPHome Kickstart firmware is only flashed once and then replaced by the custom ESPHome firmware.

The normal behavior for devices flashed with ESPHome Kickstart would have been that they open up a wifi access point that serves a website. One could use that website to set networks settings and upload the custom ESPHome firmware. That custom ESPHome firmware would then add the device to a local network and enable the user to control the device via their ESPHome dashboard, that i.e. runs inside HomeAssistant.

With the two temperature sensors I never reached that point. Eventhough the exploit run, the devices never opened up a wifi access point. Without being able to upload custom firmware, I was not able to add them to my local network and control them via ESPHome.

Another set back and this one was even trickier. Finding out what the issues was here, was not as easy, because a lot of factors were in play. It could have been the wrong device profile, something with the device itself or an issue with ESPHome Kickstart. In the end, I learned that the issues lies propably in the fact that the devices are battery powered. To safe energy from the battery, the devices only set up a wifi connection every now and then. For example the TH08 temperature sensor connects itself every hour to the cloud to update its values. This is propably controlled by the internal RTC, eventhough I can not prove it. [^1]

As none of the options worked to flash the devices wirelessly, I had no other option than opening them up and solder some wires onto them.

## Soldering

To flash the ESPHome firmware directly, wires can be soldered to the correct pins on the wifi chip and then connected to a USB to TTL UART adapter. This allows for reading and writing to the chip via USB.

The ESPHome Kickstart method failed, so a custom ESPHome firmware had to be flashed directly. Beforehand, it was necessary to create this firmware. If Kickstart had been successful, [ltchiptool](https://docs.libretiny.eu/docs/flashing/tools/ltchiptool/) could have been used to read the datapoints from a device that already provided an open wifi access point. Then, a custom ESPHome firmware could have been compiled using those points. However, with that option unavailable, an alternative firmware creation method was adopted.

For that a dumb of the original firmware had to be created. I used the reading capability of ltchiptool to create a dump of the original firmware of the TH08 temperature sensor. With the help of [kuba2k2](https://github.com/kuba2k2) and [Cossid](https://github.com/Cossid) I was able to create a [device profile](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter.github.io/blob/master/devices/emylo-csac905-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-display.json) based on that dump, which was also added to the Tuya Cloudcutter project. After the device profile was added a firmware could be created through [UPK2ESPHome](https://upk.libretiny.eu/). This website creates a YAML file for ESPHome based on the device profile.

After the YAML file was created, it was possible to compile and flash the firmware based on the YAML file with the ESPHome CLI using this command:

```bash
python -m esphome run yourdevice.yml
```

The device was now added successfully to my local network and it appeared in my ESPHome dashboard. However, the device was not working as expected. On one hand it very quickly lost connection to the network. This is because of the issue with battery powered devices I already mentioned above. However, this was not as bad because through clicking the button on top of the temperature sensor very often I could keep it awake.

So with that workaround, I was able to keep the device on the network, even if only for a certain time. However, as the device now appears in my ESPHome dashboard, I was able to compile new firmware wirelessly from here and send it to the device.

However, at this point I was still not able to control the unit as I had imagined. This is due to another chip inside the device, the TuyaMCU chip. This chip is responsible for translating the software signals from the wifi chip and passing them on to the hardware components and vice versa. Unfortunately, this chip cannot be addressed via the ESPHome Flash, which is why I did not get anywhere further at this point.

I tried out some other ways of hacking the device physically, for example I was able to read different data over the controlling pins of the PCB with an Arduino. But none of the approaches led to really gaining control over the device let alone the screen.

## tinytuya

As I was not able to flash firmware on to the device or control it through any other way I needed to find an alternative. Fortunately, I came across another project during the process called [tinytuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya), a project by [Jason Cox](https://github.com/jasonacox). tinytuya is a Python API to access Tuya WiFi devices on a local network without flashing any new firmware.

It uses different parameters, such as the Network address (IPv4) of the device, the device ID, the version of the Tuya protocol and a local key to connect to the device.

To obtain these different parameters I followed the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya/blob/master/README.md) of the project. Unfortunately this step is only possible by connecting the devices to the cloud once. This is because the local key is only generated once the device is connected to the cloud. After that, the device can be controlled locally without the need of the cloud.

With the Parameters ready I could simply write a Python script that can read different values from the device. You can find the script in the repository of this project. This is the same script that is used to control how much research is visible on this site.
