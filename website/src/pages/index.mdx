# The ☁️ around Temperature Sensors

In a class I attended at Hochschule für Künste Bremen, titled Aliexpress Archaeology, our task was to delve into the depths of Aliexpress and uncover objects that gained our interest. Aliexpress is the customer shopping platform of the Alibaba Group Holding Limited. AliExpress stands as the customer shopping arm of the Alibaba Group Holding Limited, distinctive in its direct connection to production facilities. This direct link promises the elimination of various middlemen in the delivery chain, offering products at low prices.

During my exploration of the website, my attention was quickly drawn to very affordable smart home products. I found myself particularly intrigued by a battery-powered temperature sensor, advertised as _[Tuya WIFI Temperature Humidity Sensor Indoor Hygrometer Thermometer Detector Smart Life Remote Control Support Alexa Google Home](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004755749389.html)_.[^1]

The price for the TH08 temperature sensor was 7,62€, which seems pretty low for for such a technical device. This led me to the following questions:

**How can a smart home device, which is capable of quite a lot of technical features, be offered so cheap?**

Additionally,

**What is the purpose of a cheap device likes this? Who is gaining from it?**

Beyond thie questions, the device was also appealing to me. I wanted to see if I could somehow acquire or hack the technical inner workings of the device. My original idea was to gain control over the screen and use it to project a visual narrative. Despite my attempts, I was unsuccessful which you can read more about in the [second part of the documentation](/cutting-the-cloud-away) about hacking that device.

The following chapters are broad areas of research that I stumbled upon while attempting to hack the temperature sensors. The research is divided into broad chapters that together try to provide answers to the questions above.

## Value of Labour

In our current capitalist society we express value of labour most of the times through money. To understand better how much the labour in the TH08 temperature sensor is valued, I tried to backwards engineer the price of the device. I started with looking at the PCB and calculate the prices for the individual component.

I looked up the prices for the components on the Assembly Parts Lib of JLCPCB. [^2] This is a commonly used website to produce your own PCB designs. As it is also based in Shenzhen this should give us a good reference point.
From two of the chips the label was earsed, therefore the price could not be indentified. Nevertheless, they are probably a TuyaMCU chip as well as an RTC chip. Some other components have labels but could neither be identified. [^3] [^4]

Keep in mind that this is only the price for some of the components. The plastic case, the LCD screen, all the small resistors and capacitors as well as the material for the PCB itself are not included. Even though this is a very rough estimate, it still creates a good feeling for the material costs of the device.
Substracted from the original price of the device, it leaves us with:

$$7,62€ - 4,23€ = 3,39€$$

From this remaining amount there still needs to be cost covered such as

- Other manufacturing costs except the Material BOM
- Financing costs
- Fulfillment costs
- Fixed cost
- Internal costs
- Packaging costs
- etc.

This is only the so called COGS (Cost of Goods). Markup is not even included. [^5] [^6] Eventhough this is a sketchy calculation it gives a good starting point to estimate how much the labour was valued that went into the production of this device.

## Aliexpress and Shenzhen

In an attempt to understand how the device can be offered at that price point two factors need to be considered. The first one is the platform Aliexpress itself and the second one is the location of the production facilities in Shenzhen.

As already mentioned above above, Aliexpress is the customer shopping platform of Alibaba, which is capable of offering products at low price points. Besides the point, tath manufacturers are offering their goods through Aliexpress, directly there are other reasons for the low prices. Shipping is subsidized by the chinese goverment if China Post, the national post service, is used. This leads to sellers offering free shipping to the customers on the platform. Additionally the costs of raw materials and supplies are cheap for manufactures as a Chinese government's policy ensures that manufacturers can purchase and source their materials at competitve prices. In the end also the low cost of labour needs the be considered as a way of keeping the prices low. [^7] [^8]

<Image src={shenzhen_skyline} alt="Shenzhen Skyline" />

Another important factor is the location of the production facilities in Shenzhen. Shenzhen is a special economic zone (SEZ) designated by the Chinese government, designed to promote economic growth and innovation. As an SEZ, Shenzhen enjoys various tax incentives and relaxed regulatory policies. This has attracted a multitude of manufacturers and technology companies to set up operations in the city, leading to a highly competitive market. The concentration of businesses in Shenzhen fosters intense competition among suppliers, which drives down production costs. Aliexpress sellers in Shenzhen can tap into this ecosystem of cost-efficient manufacturing and leverage the city's logistics infrastructure for efficient global shipping, ultimately contributing to the platform's ability to provide inexpensive products to consumers around the world. [^9] [^10]

## Dropshipping

Another interesting point that came to my attention was that the TH08 temperature sensor and the other ones I bought (you can find a full list in the [second part of the documentation](/cutting-the-cloud-away)) were available outside of Aliexpress. I could find several devices I bought on Aliexpress also on Amazon. The images, names and description differed only slightly but the real difference was in the price. Depending on the device the price on Amazon was up to 2.8x higher than the one on Aliexpress.

| Aliexpress                                                     | Amazon                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [TH08](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004755749389.html)   | [TH08](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B9Y4D4PR)   |
| [TH01](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005097738278.html)   | [TH01](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B8HSJ4WG)   |
| [KBZ-FR](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004492234396.html) | [KBZ-FR](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B3D4Z98S) |

This calculation makes only sense if you work with the sales price of Aliexpress but since my observation the devices have never been out of sale and I never payed more then the sales price. The high price difference as well as the mismatch in the seller led me to the thesis that the products are sold through Dropshipping.

Dropshipping is a business practise where the seller does not keep the products in stock but instead transfers the customer orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer, another retailer, or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly to the customer. Therefore a seller does not have to handle the product directly. This practise is very common on Aliexpress and explains the price difference between Aliexpress and Amazon, because otherwise the seller would not made any profit.

Another indicator for the dropshipping thesis is the [Expo website from Tuya](https://expo.tuya.com/). That platform enables sellers to buy Tuya products in high volumne from certified suppliers. On this website it is also possible to buy the [TH08 temperature sensor](https://expo.tuya.com/product/1077042) I bought from Aliexpress even with the ability to customize it.

{/* Little dropshipping critique because people earn money for nothing */}

## Proprietary Technology - <br/> TuyaMCU and Tuya Cloud

Lastly I want to raise attention to the usage of propiertary technology in these smart home devices. All the devices are equipped with WiFi modules and MCU chips from Tuya. [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com/) is a Chinese smart home company that provides technologies to others for easier smart home product development. This goes from Cloud Services, over development tools such as SDKs to WiFi chips and MCU chips, which help to easily build compatible PCBs.[^11] [^12] Through offering all these services it becomes very easy as a third party company to develop and distribute smart home products. Even though this sounds nice on the first look it is a smart move from Tuya to look the devices into their ecosystem. This means that all the devices are only compatible with the Tuya apps and the Tuya cloud. Therefore all the data that is collected by the devices is also stored on the Tuya cloud. As the offered services by Tuya are proprietary and not open-source in any way, it is not possible to use their service without relying on their cloud.

This is problematic on multiple levels. On one hand companies using their services, always need to respond to changes made by Tuya to their services without having a word in it.
As a customer this is even more problematic, because sensitive data is stored on a cloud that is not under personal control. As most customers use these devices in a very private space, most likely their homes, this becomes a big risk. Especially because it is already proven that Tuya stores a lot of information about the devices and their usage such as network status, IP addresses, locations and even images or videos, if the device used is equipped with a camera. [^12] [^13]

The [second part of this project](/cutting-the-cloud-away), is all about the attempts taken to free the devices from the Tuya cloud ecosystem, to gain more control over the data usage and using the devices more freely.
