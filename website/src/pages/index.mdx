# The World behind Temperature Sensors

During a class I attended at Hochschule für Künste Bremen, called Aliexpress Archaeology, we were asked to dig deep into Aliexpress and find objects of our interest. If you do not know Aliexpress yet, it is basically an online shopping platform to buy all kinds of goods, similar to somehing like Amazon or ebay. The difference with Aliexpress, however, is that the products sold there are supposedly directly from the production facilities, which are mostly located in Shenzhen. Through buying directly from the manufacturers a lot of middlemen in the delivery chain are extracted, which in turn results in favourable sales prices.

While exploring the website I found myself quickly interested in very cheap smart home products, that could be easily used through an app called _Smart Life_. I was especially interested in a battery powered temperature sensor advertised under the name _Tuya WIFI Temperature Humidity Sensor Indoor Hygrometer Thermometer Detector Smart Life Remote Control Support Alexa Google Home_.

The price for one temperature sensor was 7,62€, which is in my mind insanely cheap, and I aksed myself

**How can a smart home device, which is capable of quite a lot of technical features, be offered so cheap?**

and also

**How weird is it that homes in western society are modernized through propiertary technology that was most likely produced under exploitative labour practices in south east asia?**

Apart from that more sociological intererst the general device was also appealing to me. I wanted to see if I could somehow acquire or hack the technical inner workings of the device. My original idea was to somehow gain control over the screen and then use it to tell a visual narrative. I failed miserably, which you can read more about in the [technical documentation](/hacking-temperature-sensors) for hacking this device.

The following chapters are loose clusters of research I stumbled across during my attempt of hacking the temperature sensors. Through this ongoing organization of thoughts I try to find answers to the questions above.

## Value of Labour

In our current capitalist society we express value of labour through money in different currencies. To understand better how much the labour, to produce this devices, is valued I had a closer look at the price and tried to backwards engineer the price.

It was the easiest to start looking at the PCB and calculate the prices for the individual components used on it. This is what the PCB looks like. The components are annotated.

I looked up the prices for the components on the Assembly Parts Lib of JLCPCB. [^1] This is a commonly used website to produce your own PCB designs. As it is also based in Shenzen I thought this could be a good reference point.
From two chips the label was earsed, so I could not identify the exact price. Nevertheless, they are probably a TuyaMCU chip as well as an RTC chip. Some other components do have a label but could not be identified. [^2] [^3]

Keep in mind that this is only the price for the components. The plastic case, the LCD screen, all the small resistors and capacitors as well as the material for the PCB itself are not included.Even though this is a very rough estimate, it still creates a good feeling for the material costs of the device.  
Substracted from the original price of the device, it leaves us with:

$$7,62€ - 4,23€ = 3,39€$$

From this remaining amount there still needs to be covered cost such as

- Other manufacturing costs except the Material BOM
- Financing costs
- Fulfillment costs
- Fixed cost
- Internal costs
- Packaging costs
- etc.

This is only the COGS (Cost of Goods) and Markup is not even included. Eventhough this is a sketchy calculation it gives a good starting to point to estimate how much the labour was valued that went into the production of this device.

## Aliexpress and Shenzen

## Dropshipping

One day during my research I tried to find out if the TH08 temperature sensor or also the other ones I bought (you can find a full list in the [technical documentation](/hacking-temperature-sensors/)) were available outside of Aliexpress. Very quickly I found was I was looking for on Amazon. I could find the the same devices I bought on Aliexpress also on Amazon. The images, names and description differed only slightly but the real difference was in the price. Depending on the device the price on Amazon was up to 2.8x higher than the one on Aliexpress.

| Aliexpress                                                     | Amazon                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [TH08](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004755749389.html)   | [TH08](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B9Y4D4PR)   |
| [TH01](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005097738278.html)   | [TH01](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B8HSJ4WG)   |
| [KBZ-FR](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004492234396.html) | [KBZ-FR](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B3D4Z98S) |

There has been no unmarked sale on Aliexpress during my observation of the products. Accordingly, I have always paid the sales prices indicated and also calculated with those here.
The high price difference as well as the mismatch in the seller led me to the thesis that the products are sold through Dropshipping.

{/* Short definition what drop shipping is */}

{/* Aliexpress is known for dropshipping */}

Another indicator for the dropshipping thesis is the [Expo website from Tuya](https://expo.tuya.com/). That websites enables you to buy Tuya products in high volumne from certified suppliers. On this website it is also possible to buy the [TH08 wifi sensor](https://expo.tuya.com/product/1077042) even with the ability to customize it.

To provide and distribute this technology via dropshipping

## Proprietary Technology - <br/> TuyaMCU and Tuya Cloud

Lastly I want to raise attention to the usage of propiertary technology in these smart home devices. All these devices are equipped with WiFi modules and MCU chips from Tuya. Tuya is a chinese smart home company that provides technologies to others for easier smart home product development. This goes from Cloud Services, over development tools such as SDKs to Wifi chips and MCU chips, which help to easily build compatible PCBs. Through offerings all those services it becomes very easy as a third party company to develop and then dsitribute smart home products. Even though this sounds nice on the first look it is a smart move from Tuya to look the devices into their ecosystem. This means that all the devices are only compatible with the Tuya apps and the Tuya cloud. Therefore all the data that is collected by the devices is also stored on the Tuya cloud, which is located in China. Using their services without relying on their cloud is not possible.

This is problematic on multiple levels. As a company using those services you need to adapt to all the changes Tuya makes without having any control over it.
As a customer this is even more problematic, cause sensitive data is stored on a cloud that is not under your control. As most customers use these devices in a very private space, their home, this becomes a big risk. especially because it is already known that Tuya stores a lot of information about the devices and their usage such as network status, IP adresses, locations, etc. [^4]

In the second part of this project, which was also reffered to as the [technical documentation](/hacking-temperature-sensors/), you can read about attempts to free the devices from the Tuya ecosystem, to gain more control over their data usage and using them more freely.
