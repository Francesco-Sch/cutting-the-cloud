# The World behind Temperature Sensors

During a class I attended at Hochschule für Künste Bremen, called Aliexpress Archaeology, we were asked to dig deep into Aliexpress and find objects of our interest. If you do not know Aliexpress yet, it is basically an online shopping platform to buy all kinds of goods, similar to somehing like Amazon or ebay. The difference with Aliexpress, however, is that the products sold there are supposedly directly from the production facilities, which are mostly located in Shenzhen. Through buying directly from the manufacturers a lot of middlemen in the delivery chain are extracted, which in turn results in favourable sales prices.

While exploring the website I found myself quickly interested in very cheap smart home products, that could be easily used through an app called _Smart Life_. I was especially interested in a battery powered temperature sensor advertised under the name _Tuya WIFI Temperature Humidity Sensor Indoor Hygrometer Thermometer Detector Smart Life Remote Control Support Alexa Google Home_.

The price for one temperature sensor was 7,62€, which is in my mind insanely cheap, and I aksed myself

> How can a smart home device, which is capable of quite a lot of technical features, be offered so cheap?

and also

> How weird is it that homes of western society are modernized through propiertary technology that was most likely produced under exploitative labour practices in south east asia?

Apart from that more sociological intererst the general device was also appealing to me. I wanted to see if I could somehow acquire or hack the technical inner workings of the device. My original idea was to somehow gain control over the screen and then use it to tell a visual narrative. I failed miserably, which you can read more about in the [technical documentation](/hacking-temperature-sensors) for hacking this device.

The following chapters are loose clusters of research I stumbled across during my attempt of hacking the temperature sensors. Through this ongoing organization of thoughts I try to find answers to the questions above.

## Aliexpress and Shenzen

## Value of Labour

In our current capitalist society we express value of labour through money in different currencies. To understand better how much the labour, to produce this devices, is valued I had a closer look at the price and tried to backwards engineer the price.

It was the easiest to start looking at the PCB and calculate the prices for the individual components used on it. This is what the PCB looks like:

I looked up the prices for the components on the websites PCBway and JLPCB. These are commonly used website I know to produce your own PCB design. As they are also based in Shenzen I thought this could be a good reference point.

| Item         | Price    | # In stock |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| Juicy Apples | 1.99     | _7_        |
| Bananas      | **1.89** | 5234       |
