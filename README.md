# Cutting the Cloud

As our homes become smarter, a new technological infrastructure is becoming an integral part of our homes. It is changing the way we behave and interact with one of our most private and sensitive spaces.

Cutting the Cloud is an artistic research and hacking project that explores the multiple layers surrounding smart home technology, using a cheap, battery-powered temperature sensor as an example. The project attempts to shed light on the origins and purposes of the sensor, who it is still connected to, and asks how it can ultimately become free.

The research and insights gained by looking at the temperature sensor from different perspectives have been collected in an interactive website. Through freeing the temperature sensor from the cloud it became part of the website controlling how much of the research will be visible in the end.
